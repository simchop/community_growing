      <description>The locations of the two walks are indicated on this interactive map, each location to be visited is indicated with a number and can be zoomed in on the map. These specific places are open for reimagining, possibly to be rewilded or used to grow food in the neighbourhood. The map will be further populated using the Grow Green Futures Team members suggestions after the walks. Please stay tuned as we reimagine the neighbourhoodâ€™s public spaces.</description>
