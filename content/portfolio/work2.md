#### Pop-up farms have been created using stacked shipping containers to create food growing infrastructure available and accessible in the neighbourhood.

#### Local community business around plants and vegetables has taken off quite nicely, now they earn money from selling plants, vegetables, seeds and compost just like a garden centre.

#### To solve the problem of the litter in the area the community has developed a communal composting hub where the neighbourhood collects everyday compostable waste. The compost hub is fully self-sufficient by selling high-quality compost.

#### The community has developed an entrepreneurial business of edible weeds by producing exotic drinks and food items that are not available in supermarkets.
