#### Machines for weeding have become a household technology for urban food growers leaving ample time for them to pursue other pleasures in life.
#### People for plant support, a scheme launched by the community arranges for neighbours or installs technology to take care of plants when the owner is on holiday these kind of plant sitting activities have become a norm for community building and sharing in the North East.
#### The council has started a neighbourhood planter scheme which supports people in planting and maintaining the planters throughout the year because earlier people thought they didnâ€™t have enough money, equipment or manpower to take care of them.
#### The public growing spaces like planters and the allotments allocated by the council are co-owned as a community asset. This law was put in action to ban single person or council ownership to provide land security to the community.
