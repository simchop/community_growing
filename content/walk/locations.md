<!-- Thank you for joining us today to mindfully explore the neighbourhood through our 10-minute audio-guided meditative visioning walk. It is in partnership with the Greening wingrove CIC promoting community growing and green spaces in your neighbourhood. Just remember there is no right or wrong way to do this exercise. It is simply a guide to help you reimagine the neighbourhood’s public spaces, today. So now all we have to do is to begin walking and do remember to take your headphones as you listen to the audio. -->

The locations of the two walks are indicated on this interactive map, each location to be visited is indicated with a number and can be zoomed in on the map. These specific places are open for reimagining, possibly to be rewilded or used to grow food in the neighbourhood. The map will be further populated using the Grow Green Futures Team members suggestions after the walks. Please stay tuned as we reimagine the neighbourhood’s public spaces.
