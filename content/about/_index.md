It is the year 2035. With the recent decline in greenery, effects of climate change, and high pollution, large-scale unsustainable food production has been drasically reduced. The government is encouraging people to grow food to respond to the short supply of some types of food. The role of the Grow Green Futures Team is to  find ways to increase food growing in your neighbourhood to help sustain current and future generations.

Today, our task is to explore how we might work together to turn urban concrete areas into green spaces for growing food. Throughout the neighbourhood, we’ve already placed some time windows where you can peek into possible futures with the help of your phone.

We’re asking you to walk to each of these time windows and help us explore - How might we grow food in the neighbourhood in future? 

What could we grow, and where? 

How might we bring nature and wildlife back into our neighbourhood? 

What would it look like if we did?

How could we achieve these things together as a community?

What technologies, tools, skills, and knowledge would we need?

Please also join the WhatsApp group to share your ideas with other members of the team.
