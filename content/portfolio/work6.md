#### All the roofs have been covered by solar panels, a combined private and public collaboration to green and clean the west end neighbourhood. This initiative has provided free electricity enough to run greenhouses and polytunnels in the backyards and backlanes supporting food growing in the neighbourhood. Making it a place of interest for visitors and tourists alike, encouraging the possibility of entrepreneurial ventures
#### Sensor based devices have been deployed in food growing areas to monitor intrusion and deter trespassers. It only allows people with special access tags in to the community growing spaces and raises an alarm for anyone else.
#### The backlanes have been converted into growing areas for winters which is shared and cared by the community members. This conversion came into being through a citizen created and signed policy that helped create guidelines for converting backyard private spaces into public shared ones
#### A food growing rebate has been introduced by the council in the west end to encourage people to grow part of their own food. The rebate includes free water and council compost for the community.
