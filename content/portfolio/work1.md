#### Experimentation by citizens is underway to determine the new climate hardy varieties of vegetables and fruits to counteract climate change effects on food growing in Britain.
#### The community knowledge exchange organisation set up by the neighbourhood is supporting schools with growing activities and encouraging intergenerational exchange. The programme connects the older to the younger generations making students important contributors to food growing initiatives.
#### The community has developed DIY tool kits and teaching sessions for its members to become self-reliant in making soil probes and interpreting its readings about soil composition to make better decisions around growing.
#### The mineral composition device provided to the people of the community can detect the mineral composition of the soil at different areas and suggests the needed elements or minerals necessary to enrich the soil. It has made food growing easier and interesting.
