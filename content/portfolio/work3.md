#### The free food project was made possible by dedicating all of the available space into growing perennial vegetables and fruits.
#### Fruit trees lining the neighbourhood provide fruit in abundance while still facing issues with fallen fruits and gluts leading to waste.
#### Due to food shortages in the north east all the available green space and abandoned or old buildings have been converted into community spaces for growing food.
#### A new device has been put in place in the neighbourhood to monitor and collect the life sign data of different species including plants, animals and insects to take into account their wellbeing. This device is linked to the eco-monitor installed by the residents which helps them create changes in their ecosystem according to the suggestion given by the eco-monitor. This has led to more biodiversity and balanced ecosystem in the neighbourhood.
