#### Swopping and bartering have become an integral part of the community because of the new digital platform which uses existing social media helping people to communicate via video calls, connect through council run infrastructure and share their grown surplus with the ones who would want it.
#### To help the community become 25% self-sufficient in their food needs, empty buildings and carparks have been converted into growing spaces with the help of local organic farmers who act as visiting experts to assist in growing at this scale in the neighbourhood .
#### Celebrations around food produce are more common now within communities, this was done to increase sociability, counter capitalist culture and slow down people's lives.
#### Increased sociability and communication platforms in the community have given rise to more empathy, bonding and ideas. This was a welcome change, in the times of economic and climate uncertainty.
